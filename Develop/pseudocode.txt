Initial Setup

Create a variable for password length, this will be set by the user input.
Create an array of every lower case letter.
Create an array of every upper case letter.
Create an array of every number 0-9.
Create an array of special characters.
Define boolean variables for each type including lower, upper, numbers and special characters.
Define an output password string variable.


User Input Stage

Create a prompt that shows up when you click the button
This prompt should have an input field that allows the user to choose a password length between 8 and 128 characters.
If the user enters something other than a number between 8 and 128, reject the input and retry.
If the user inputs a valid number, define the password length variable with that number.
Create confirms asking about each boolean variable type.
Store each response for each boolean variable.


Character Array Creation

Using the newly defined boolean variables, create a master array from the arrays with true booleans. Do this with if statements and appends.


Password Generation

Create a loop function that iterates up to the variable for password length.
In this loop, run a random number generator, multiply by the master array length, and use this as an index to choose a random character from the master array.
Return this into the password variable, and continue to repeat until the password length is reached.

Once that has happened, use an appendtext to add the password to the display, or put it in an alert.
